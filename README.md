# bre4k-sh3ll
By N1kz0.


This is my personal [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) configuration, designed with a **Breakcore-inspired aesthetic** and focused on minimal, terminal-based visuals.

---

### **IMPORTANT**
Before installing, make sure to edit the config as i use the french keyboard layout.

Go to `$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` and scroll down to "INPUTS", change KB layout to your desired one. You will also need to change the "Workspaces and Move to workspaces" input in `$HOME/.config/hypr/keybindings.conf`.

Be sure to also check if every config files have the right usernames and locations. Also run waypaper or use `waypaper --random` to use a random image in your `$HOME/Pictures/wallpapers/` directory.

## üì¶ Requirements

> üêß This setup assumes you're on **Arch Linux** or an **Arch-based distro** (like EndeavourOS, Artix, etc.). Which is why the repo has 2 scripts. One script is to install all the packages and place them (Arch based). And another one will just place them.
Or you can just clone the repo and do it yourself

Every packages and libraries needed are listed in the 'requirements.txt' file. If you have any questions or concerns about the **integrity or safety** of any packages, check the [AUR package list](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages) or from your distro, or check the github repos that are linked. 
Note that every packages used have been tested and checked before installation.

---

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/NikzoOff/bre4k-sh3ll

```
---

Things left to do at the time:
- [] Make the Arch-based installation script
- [] Make the "Universal" installation script (just copying and placing files)
- [] Get GTK themes to work with pywal (help is greatly appreciated)
