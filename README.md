# bre4k-sh3ll
By N1kz0.


This is my personal Zsh configuration, designed with a **Breakcore-inspired aesthetic** and focused on minimal, terminal-based visuals.

It includes:

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) (might needed to install it yourself. Double check after install)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [Pywal Integration](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) (Used almost everywhere in the config)
- [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) (For Terminal startup)
- A Custom [TUI Theme](https://github.com/adriankarlen/textfox) For Firefox
- [PywalFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pywalfox/) (Might needed to install it yourself)
- [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) (Handmade config inspired by [DerAnsari](https://github.com/DerAnsari/hyprland-dots/tree/main/waybar))

## üì¶ Requirements

> üêß This setup assumes you're on **Arch Linux** or an **Arch-based distro** (like EndeavourOS, Artix, etc.). Which is why the repo has 2 scripts. One script is to install all the packages and place them (Arch based). And another one will just place them.
Or you can just clone the repo and do it yourself

- Zsh
- Oh My Zsh
- Powerlevel10k
- Nerd Font installed (like FiraCode Nerd Font)
- pywal
- Hyprland (Wayland compositor)
- Waybar
- Rofi
- Firefox (with [TextFox] (https://github.com/adriankarlen/textfox)

## üöÄ Quick Setup

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/NikzoOff/bre4k-sh3ll

# 2 install scripts are provided. One is for arch-based distro to install all the packages. The other one is just to clone the files to the required directories
