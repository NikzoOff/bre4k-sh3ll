# bre4k-sh3ll
By N1kz0.


This is my personal Zsh configuration, designed with a **Breakcore-inspired aesthetic** and focused on minimal, terminal-based visuals.

It includes:

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) for dynamic theming
- Custom aliases and shell tweaks
- A setup built for use with **Hyprland**, **Waybar**, **Rofi**, and **Firefox** (with the "TextFox" TUI-style theme)
